            <h2>Backpack</h2>
            <img src="../images/placeholder-backpack.jpg" alt="Survival Backpack" class="kit-img">
            <p>
                Choose a durable, water-resistant tactical backpack with multiple compartments.
                A 35–45L capacity is ideal — big enough for essentials but small enough for mobility.
                Look for padded shoulder straps and a sternum strap for long treks.
            </p>
            <p><em>Tip:</em> Test your pack fully loaded before you commit to it. Comfort saves lives.</p>

            <h2>Boots & Socks</h2>
            <img src="../images/placeholder-boots.jpg" alt="Boots and Socks" class="kit-img">
            <p>
                Invest in mid-weight hiking boots with ankle support and waterproof lining.
                Combine them with synthetic, moisture-wicking socks. Cotton kills — it traps moisture and leads to
                blisters or infections.
            </p>
            <p><em>Tip:</em> Carry 3 pairs of socks and rotate them daily to keep your feet dry.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Clothing & Jacket</h2>
            <img src="../images/placeholder-jacket.jpg" alt="Jacket and Pants" class="kit-img">
            <p>
                Two shirts and a pair of quick-dry pants will do. Add a light jacket for insulation and rain protection.
                Avoid heavy fabrics — synthetic or ripstop materials dry faster and last longer.
            </p>
            <p><em>Tip:</em> Dress in layers. The weather changes faster than you think.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Firestarter</h2>
            <img src="../images/placeholder-firestarter.jpg" alt="Firestarter Kit" class="kit-img">
            <p>
                Fire means warmth, light, and cooked food. Keep waterproof matches, a ferro rod, and dry tinder in a
                sealed pouch.
                A small butane lighter is a great backup — bring two if you can.
            </p>
            <p><em>Tip:</em> Practice starting a fire before the apocalypse. Panic and wet wood don’t mix.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Water & Purification</h2>
            <img src="../images/placeholder-water.jpg" alt="Water Bottle and Tablets" class="kit-img">
            <p>
                Carry at least one sturdy, silent water bottle — avoid metal that clanks.
                Include purification tablets or a small filter straw for backup when boiling isn’t possible.
            </p>
            <p><em>Tip:</em> Always refill when you pass a water source. You never know when the next one will appear.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Knife & Multi-Tool</h2>
            <img src="../images/placeholder-knife.jpg" alt="Knife and Multitool" class="kit-img">
            <p>
                A fixed-blade knife is essential for cutting, defense, and food prep.
                Pair it with a multi-tool for quick repairs and gear adjustments.
            </p>
            <p><em>Tip:</em> Keep your blade sharp. A dull knife is more dangerous than a sharp one.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Hygiene & First Aid</h2>
            <img src="../images/placeholder-hygiene.jpg" alt="Hygiene and First Aid Kit" class="kit-img">
            <p>
                Include soap, toothbrush, wipes, and disinfectant.
                For first aid: adhesive bandages, antiseptic, painkillers, and any prescriptions.
                A small sewing kit can patch clothes or skin in a pinch.
            </p>
            <p><em>Tip:</em> Staying clean keeps you alive — infection is the silent killer.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Navigation & Light</h2>
            <img src="../images/placeholder-compass.jpg" alt="Compass and Flashlight" class="kit-img">
            <p>
                GPS will fail eventually. Keep a physical map, a reliable compass, and a durable flashlight with spare
                batteries.
            </p>
            <p><em>Tip:</em> Red light modes preserve night vision and attract less attention.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Food & Rations</h2>
            <img src="../images/placeholder-rations.jpg" alt="Food Rations" class="kit-img">
            <p>
                High-calorie, non-perishable food like protein bars, dried fruits, and jerky can sustain you for days.
                Pack light but nutrient-dense meals that don’t require cooking.
            </p>
            <p><em>Tip:</em> Eat small portions steadily to maintain energy and morale.</p>
        </section>

            <h2>Extras</h2>
            <img src="../images/placeholder-extras.jpg" alt="Extra Gear" class="kit-img">
            <p>
                Add a bandana (for dust or first aid), gloves, a poncho, and sunglasses.
                A small radio or whistle can save your life if you need to signal others.
            </p>
            <p><em>Tip:</em> Redundancy is key — carry backups of critical tools in miniature form.</p>
