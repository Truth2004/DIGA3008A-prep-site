                <strong>It began with curiosity, greed, and desperation.</strong> In high-security laboratories hidden
                from public view,
                scientists pushed the limits of genetic engineering and viral therapy. They sought a cure for the
                world's
                deadliest diseases — but in their ambition, they underestimated the power of the unknown.

            <h2>The First Outbreak</h2>
            <img src="../images/first-outbreak.jpeg" alt="First Outbreak" class="kit-img">
            <p>
                The initial breach happened quietly. A single lab technician ignored protocol and became patient zero.
                At first,
                symptoms mimicked a severe flu: fever, nausea, disorientation. But within 48 hours, the infection
                rewired the brain,
                stripping away empathy, fear, and reason. The first undead awoke — relentless, violent, and unstoppable.
            </p>
            <p>
                Attempts to contain the infection were futile. Quarantine zones failed. Emergency response teams were
                overrun.
                Panic spread faster than the virus. Entire towns vanished overnight, leaving only bloodstains and
                screams.
            </p>

            <h2>Mutation & Adaptation</h2>
            <img src="../images/virus.jpeg" alt="Virus Spread" class="kit-img">
            <p>
                The virus evolved with terrifying speed. It adapted to human hosts, environmental conditions, and even
                predator
                patterns. Survivors reported strange behaviors: undead avoiding traps, hunting in packs, and sometimes
                using
                rudimentary problem-solving skills. It became clear that this was not just an illness — it was an
                intelligent
                predator.
            </p>
            <p>
                Transmission was horrifyingly easy: a single scratch, a bite, or contact with contaminated surfaces
                could trigger
                the infection. Entire communities became incubators for the rapidly spreading plague.
            </p>

            <h2>The Collapse of Civilization</h2>
            <img src="../images/empty-street.jpeg" alt="Zombie Apocalypse" class="kit-img">
            <p>
                Governments fell within weeks. Cities burned as chaos reigned. Military forces tried to enforce order
                but
                were overwhelmed. Survivors became refugees in their own lands, fleeing to remote areas or fortified
                compounds.
                Communication networks failed. Supply chains collapsed. Humanity’s once-great cities turned into hunting
                grounds
                for the undead.
            </p>
            <p>
                Desperation bred both heroism and horror. Communities formed and fell. Some survivors banded together to
                reclaim
                pockets of land; others succumbed to greed, violence, or despair.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2>The Mutation Beyond Humans</h2>
            <img src="../images/test-rat.jpeg" alt="Mutated Zombies" class="kit-img">
            <p>
                Scientists warned that the virus could jump species. It didn’t take long. Wild animals — dogs, birds,
                even larger
                predators — became carriers. Entire forests and rural regions turned into deadly zones. Travelers
                reported packs
                of infected animals coordinating attacks alongside human undead. Nature itself seemed to rise against
                the living.
            </p>
            <p>
                Survival became a matter of skill, adaptability, and luck. Knowledge, often taken for granted, was now
                the most valuable commodity. Those who couldn’t adapt were quickly eliminated.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>The Rise of Survivor Societies</h2>
            <img src="../images/survivor-camp.jpeg" alt="Survivor Camp" class="kit-img">
            <p>
                Out of chaos, small communities of survivors began to form. Some fortified towns using salvaged
                materials.
                Others became nomadic groups, constantly moving to avoid hordes. Leadership was earned through skill and
                resourcefulness. Cooperation became essential, as the old world’s conveniences no longer existed.
            </p>
            <p>
                These groups developed new rules: rationed food, shared duties, watch shifts, and emergency signals.
                Communities
                without structure fell quickly. Those who endured learned the deadly lesson that every decision could be
                the difference between life and death.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2>The New World</h2>
            <img src="../images/post.jpeg" alt="Post-Apocalypse" class="kit-img">
            <p>
                The world as it once was no longer exists. Forests have overtaken suburbs. Cities stand as monuments to
                human hubris. The infected roam unchecked, a constant reminder of humanity’s failure to control the
                very tools it created. Yet, hope persists. Survivors still adapt, fight, and rebuild — one day at a
                time.
            </p>
            <p><em>Tip:</em> Trust is earned, not given. Every encounter could change the course of your survival story.
