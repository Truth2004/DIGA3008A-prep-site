                <h1>How to Build a Fire in the Zombie Apocalypse</h1>
                <p>
                    Building a fire in a wilderness of calm and beauty on one of your wild but fun outings would be an
                    enjoyable adventure. Maybe you even have a companion to chat with as you enjoy the exciting feeling
                    of reinventing one of those technologies that changed the life of humans. “Yes!” Your leap of joy
                    when the fire is made.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But this is not one of those party moments in a wilderness-discovery-voyage. No! It’s your survival
                    hideout.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And you are not even hiding. Because they are all over. They can show up any moment, and in their
                    numbers. The thought of it sends a chill to your spine. But no, it’s not time to chill. You are
                    cold, and famished, and worst of all parch-thirsty. You brought some water from a river you crossed
                    along your escape trail. It’s brown, the sight of a cup of chocolate. It would be great if it were.
                    In reality, it would already be part of your blood by now. But no, you need it sanitized before you
                    gulp it down your throat.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How though? It’s your fourth week of <em>operation zombie escape.</em> No more matches, even your
                    cigar lighter is spent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How dumb could you be? The book! Yes, you need to build a fire. And you got the book of survival.
                    Its first chapter: <strong>How to build a fire in the zombie apocalypse.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Choose your method carefully. Your task is not just building a fire to warm up, roast some fish you
                    caught at the river, and sterilize your desired drink. You also got to disperse the smoke if you
                    don’t want the undead trailing you down. There are also the survivors fighting for their lives like
                    you. If they are still sane, they may want part of your supply. If they are infected, well, more
                    zombie numbers to run from.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It’s time to start working. So let’s read <em>‘how to make a fire in the zombie apocalypse.’</em>
                    The writer was generous, and there’s choice in the methods.

                <h2>Method #1: Friction on Wood Fire</h2>
                <p>
                    You will forego long hours of warming up and just roast a couple of fish and boil your drink. This
                    place doesn’t seem safe. The undead could be on your trail. Creating friction on wood is your
                    easiest and cheapest choice. The wilderness is rich with the material you need. Here’s what the book
                    says on how to build a fire with the friction method:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Find a piece of wood to serve as your fireboard and cut a groove into it. Your choice of wood
                        should be dry but not too hard.</li>
                    <li>Find a finer piece of wood to serve as a spindle. This should be hard enough to resist the
                        friction.</li>
                    <li>Create a tinder nest with material that easily catches fire, it could be dry grass or leaves.
                    </li>
                    <li>Place your tinder nest around the groove on your fireboard and introduce the spindle into the
                        hollow.</li>
                    <li>Spin to make friction until it can make a fire and create an ember on your tinder nest.</li>
                    <li>Place the burning tinder nest into a pile of fine pieces of wood that you made beforehand. You
                        can introduce bigger pieces of wood to make the fire stronger.</li>
                    <li>Your fire is made and you can roast your fish once the coal is created. You can also use any
                        steel container you may still have to boil your water.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section class="method">
                <h2>Method #2: Stone Spark Fire</h2>
                <p>
                    This method is also good because the material is handy. You could consider it in place of the
                    friction on wood fire. Just that the trick might be harder to hit here. What does your book say
                    about this method?
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Find two pieces of stone. One bigger, the other smaller. One must be harder than the other.</li>
                    <li>Let the bigger stone be the softer choice and the smaller harder and pointed at one end.</li>
                    <li>Prepare a tinder with material that catches fire easily, glass or dry leaves.</li>
                    <li>Strike the bigger and softer stone with the smaller, harder and pointed stone. Strike hard
                        enough to create a spark directed to the tinder.</li>
                    <li>The spark will create fire on the tinder. You may use your hand or a cap to fan the spark to an
                        ember.</li>
                    <li>Place the ember on your pile of fine branches to make the big fire and add the bigger pieces of
                        wood to sustain it.</li>
                    <li>Your fish can now be roasted, your drink sterilized, and, if you need to, warm your body while
                        the food and water get ready.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section class="method">
                <h2>Method #3: The Tunnel Fire</h2>
                <p>
                    This method uses the skills in method #1 or #2. The uniqueness of the method is that it could be
                    your best option when you have found a location that the undead may not easily spot — a cave behind
                    an isolated hill or a valley inside a dark thicket. It’s finally time to read about how to build a
                    fire that lasts.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Dig a wide and relatively deep hole, 15 inches wide and 20 inches deep.</li>
                    <li>On the side from where the wind blows, dig a 1-meter tunnel, shallow at the beginning and deeper
                        as it connects to your fire hole. This lets oxygen in to keep it burning.</li>
                    <li>On the other side, dig a tunnel half as deep but at least 100 meters long. Cover it with wood
                        and soil so smoke only escapes at the end.</li>
                    <li>Let the tunnel end under a thick shrub to disperse smoke and avoid the undead spotting your
                        location.</li>
                    <li>Use method #1 or #2 to light your fire inside the hole. Once burning, cover the hole with a
                        stone so smoke exits through the long tunnel.</li>
                    <li>You can use the hot stone to cook or roast food. And if they find you—some zombie might roast
                        their foot on it, buying you another minute to escape.</li>
                    <li>Your tunnel fire will serve you for days or weeks — or until it’s safe to return home.</li>
                </ul>
