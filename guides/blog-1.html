        <h1>5 Ways to Survive a Zombie Apocalypse You Probably Haven’t Thought Of</h1>
        <p>So, just because the Zombie Apocalypse hasn’t happened yet, doesn’t mean it won’t! Are you prepared if it
            does? What will you do!?!</p>
        <p>Chances are since you’re on <strong>DIGA3008A-prep-site</strong> you’ve probably thought more about the
            zombie apocalypse than most.</p>
        <p>There are tons of books and articles about basic zombie survival tips from fortifying your home to choosing
            the best weapon for killing walkers (it’s a machete). They mostly seem to have the same information. We took
            it a step further and compiled a list of ways to help you survive the zombie apocalypse.</p>
        <p><strong>Here are 5 advanced zombie survival tips you won’t find anywhere else.</strong></p>

        <section id="office">
            <h2>1. Go to an Office Complex to Forage for Essentials</h2>
            <p>Offices are a great place to go to stock up on essential survival supplies. In an office park you can
                find 3 of the most important items to keep you alive: first aid kits, drinkable water, and
                non-perishable food. Few people think "business park" when they think survival, so there’s a good chance
                they haven’t been touched by other foragers. Plus, because no one goes to work during a zombie
                apocalypse there will probably be little to no zombies there.</p>

            <h3>Drinkable Water</h3>
            <p>One of the biggest obstacles to staying alive during a zombie apocalypse is dehydration. While
                dehydration affects seniors and young kids more often, even the most fit person can suffer from a lack
                of hydration. So finding potable water is key.</p>
            <p>One of the best places to find clean drinking water can be in the office water cooler. Most offices have
                some kind of water dispenser. Many of these use 5-gallon water jugs — sealed and easy to transport —
                which can provide you with weeks’ worth of drinking water while you figure out a permanent solution.</p>
            <p>While you’re foraging, look for a bottleless water cooler. These hydration machines usually have sealed
                tanks filled with drinking water, perfect for refilling canteens on the go. Plus, you can use the
                filters inside them for water filtration.</p>

            <h3>First Aid Kits</h3>
            <p>All businesses are required to have fully stocked first aid kits — it’s an OSHA safety requirement. You
                can find bandages, gauze, splints, and wound cleaning agents such as sealed moistened towelettes. Many
                kits also contain medicine like acetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen (Advil) to help reduce fever and
                inflammation, along with stomach medicine like Pepto Bismol.</p>

            <h3>Food</h3>
            <p>Vending machines are post-apocalyptic treasure chests. While many chips and candies won’t provide much
                nutrition, they offer high amounts of calories to keep you going until your next meal. A sweet candy bar
                can even offer a brief escape from the hellish apocalypse.</p>
            <p>Because treats will become a rarity, vending machine items can also be used for bartering to get needed
                supplies. As a bonus, some vending machines even contain painkillers like Advil and Tylenol.</p>

        <section id="denim">
            <h2>2. Sew Together Layers of Denim</h2>
            <p>One of the most immediate dangers of a zombie apocalypse is a bite from the rotting dead. Why not wear
                something to stop the bites? That’s where denim comes in. A single layer probably wouldn’t offer much
                protection, but in medieval times, poor soldiers wore layers of linen quilted together as armor — which
                worked decently well.</p>
            <p>The same approach would work for zombies. Sewing together three layers of quilted denim could provide
                enough protection to stop a bite. Denim is also lightweight and breathable, so you won’t overheat while
                wearing it compared to riot armor or a leather jacket.</p>

        <section id="spray">
            <h2>3. Get Some Spray Paint</h2>
            <p>Grab a couple cans of spray paint. Simply spray a tree or wall to mark where you’ve already explored.
                This helps your group find you if separated. You can also write messages to other survivors — to warn of
                danger or signal helicopters flying overhead. Just make sure to write legibly.</p>

        <section id="booze">
            <h2>4. Stockpile Some Booze</h2>
            <p>While you don’t want to be drunk during a zombie apocalypse, it’s smart to collect high-proof alcohol. It
                works great for cleaning wounds and as an anesthetic. If you grab quality liquor, it also has trade
                value.</p>
            <p>And yes — it can help numb the pain of loss and fear, but drink responsibly!</p>

        <section id="electric-car">
            <h2>5. Drive an Electric Car</h2>
            <p>The biggest advantage of an electric car is how quiet it is — you can drive into a town without
                attracting zombies. Because they’re rechargeable, they won’t run out of fuel. You might think that’s
                useless without electricity in a zombie-ridden world, but you can solve that with solar power.</p>
            <p>Set up your shelter with a solar installation to charge your car and other survival gadgets. Even a small
                setup of 10 solar panels can provide enough power to charge your vehicle’s battery.</p>

        <section id="conclusion">
            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p>Whether or not the zombie apocalypse ever comes, it’s always good to be prepared. By preparing ahead of
                time and getting your supplies in order — and keeping your mind sharp — you’ll have everything you need
                to survive. Just in case.</p>
