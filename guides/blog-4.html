                <h2>How Long Can Humans Survive Without Water?</h2>
                <p>
                    Proper hydration is essential. Humans excrete water constantly through sweat and urination. About
                    60% of body weight consists of water, and children are more susceptible to dehydration. Survival
                    time without water varies based on activity, age, climate, health, and food intake.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some foods contain water, but beverages like alcohol and caffeine can dehydrate you. Water is more
                    critical than food: humans may survive a few weeks without food, but only a few days without water.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Recommendations: men should consume ~125 ounces and women ~93 ounces of water daily, from foods and
                    drinks combined. Thirst is your main signal, but you must act before dehydration becomes critical.

            <!-- Survival Tips -->
            <section class="method">
                <h2>Survival Tips Without Water</h2>

                <h3>Do Not Get Nervous</h3>
                <p>
                    Keep your cool. The average human can survive up to 5 days without water, but dehydration quickly
                    leads to lethargy, confusion, and rapid heartbeat. Stay motivated, focus on breathing, and move
                    slowly.
                </p>

                <h3>Do Not Sweat It</h3>
                <p>
                    Conserve fluids by minimizing exertion and perspiration. Avoid running around; physical and mental
                    agility decreases quickly if you lose water too fast.
                </p>

                <h3>Do Not Just Munch on Snowballs</h3>
                <p>
                    Eating snow can lower your body temperature dangerously. Melt snow first if necessary, but don’t
                    rely on it long-term. Look for animal tracks to find water sources nearby.
                </p>

                <h3>Look for Banana Trees</h3>
                <p>
                    In jungles, banana trees can provide water. Using a knife, carve a bowl in the top of the trunk to
                    collect fluids. This can help quench thirst temporarily.
                </p>

                <h3>Make Use of Gravity</h3>
                <p>
                    In deserts or valleys, walk downhill to find water in crevices. Cutting a cactus and extracting
                    moisture is another method—avoid eating the pulp. Situational creativity is key for survival without
                    water.

            <!-- Conclusion -->
            <section class="method">
                <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
                <p>
                    Maintaining sufficient water in your body is crucial. Without it, you will only survive a few days.
                    Monitor your thirst, conserve energy, and seek water actively. Survival without water is
                    challenging, but knowing these methods increases your chances of success.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Acting quickly and efficiently is critical. Succeeding in this challenge will give you a sense of
                    pride and accomplishment.
