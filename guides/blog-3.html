                <p>
                    You made it! You survived the first wave of zombie attacks. But by now you have realized that the
                    food you have always taken for granted is now a limited resource. The human body can survive up to
                    three weeks without food, but if you want to stay among the living, you will need to find your own
                    source of food soon enough.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Eating anything you find in the wild, however, may turn just as deadly as starving. Make sure you
                    know what you’re doing by checking our guide from day one in the wilderness to becoming a survival
                    expert.

                <h2>Survival Food for Beginners</h2>
                <p>
                    If you are new to surviving in the wild, the safest route is to go for fruits in season. Berries
                    like blueberries, blackberries, strawberries, cranberries, and raspberries are both delicious and
                    safe. Some poisonous variations exist, but the risk is low.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fruits such as wild apples, agave, and cactus are tasty and accessible even for beginners. Edible
                    flowers like wild roses, violets, and black locust provide fibers and vitamins, though they are low
                    in energy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Insects are a nutritious source of protein. Grasshoppers, ants, beetles, and crickets can be
                    gathered and roasted over a fire. Make sure to remove inedible parts and cook crickets to kill
                    possible parasites.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Roots are available almost all year, easy to store, and can be eaten raw if needed. Examples include
                    water lily roots, taro roots, Jerusalem artichoke roots, bamboo, and watercress shoots.
                </p>

                <h2>Getting Comfortable in the Wilderness</h2>
                <p>
                    Once you know your surroundings, higher-protein food sources become available. Reptiles and
                    amphibians like turtles, frogs, snakes, and salamanders can be caught safely and cooked over a fire.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lizards are harder to catch, but amphibians in lakes and streams can be caught with bare hands. Eggs
                    from nearby birds are an excellent protein source. Mushrooms must be picked carefully—only
                    chanterelles, boletes, and morels are reliably edible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Freshwater fish and other seafood are another great source of protein and fat. Using traps is more
                    reliable than trying to catch them with hands or a spear.
                </p>

                <h2>Wilderness Survival Food for Experts</h2>
                <p>
                    While berries, roots, and reptiles keep you alive, you’ll need more energy from birds and small
                    game. Invest time in traps and tools. Start with ducks, wild turkeys, pigeons, hares, and squirrels.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As you gain experience, hunt larger game such as white-tailed deer, wild boar, or moose. These
                    provide high-quality food and can be preserved for the winter. Learning to preserve meat and skins
                    is essential for long-term survival.
